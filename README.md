# HW04

## Deadline: 10.10.2023, 23:59

### Assigned by @kajigor

* Experiment with GADTs: modify the expression language with some more non-trivial kinds of expressions. Implement the evaluator and provide a way evaluate a string.

### Notes

* I encourage you to create a proper stack project to make it easier to run, test and develop your programs. If you need any help with that, do text @kajigor on telegram.

* A nice application of GADTs besides modelling a statically typed programming language can be found [here](https://chrispenner.ca/posts/gadt-design).
