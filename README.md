# HW03

## Deadline: 03.10.2023, 23:59

### Assigned by @kajigor

* Write tests for the data structures implemented as a part of HW01 and HW02. Make sure to use unit tests and property-based testing appropriately.

### Notes

* I encourage you to create a proper stack project to make it easier to run, test and develop your programs. If you need any help with that, do text @kajigor on telegram.

* In the lecture, I used the example application from the [Haskell in Depth](https://www.manning.com/books/haskell-in-depth) book which is not available for free, however the [code](https://github.com/bravit/hid-examples) is. Take a look at the [ip/](https://github.com/bravit/hid-examples/tree/61bad27de441d05713a2d1000be4697a23e72f8e/ip) and [tests/iplookup](https://github.com/bravit/hid-examples/tree/61bad27de441d05713a2d1000be4697a23e72f8e/tests/iplookup) directories for a more involved example of property-based testing.

The recording of the lecture will appear in this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQsQ42jQ8PJEF8KmvQfSghy6oGXpXr5Am)
